# Quantification for words-as-classifiers

Both the project itself and this readme are still in their very early work-in-progress stages. That said, feel free to contact me with any suggestions.

An extension of the words-as-classifiers reference resolution performed in [Schlangen et al. (2016). "Resolving References to Objects in Photographs using the Words-As-Classifiers Model"](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/publications/Schlangen-2016.pdf) and [Kennington et al. (2015). "Simple Learning and Compositional Application of Perceptually Grounded Word Meanings for Incremental Reference Resolution"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1029.pdf). The goal is to add the ability to parse quantificational noun phrases rather than merely definite singular noun phrases. At the moment, the plan is to implement a simulation using a threshold to turn the probability distributions produced by classifiers into traditional boolean sets and then to compare this with an implementation that uses fuzzy sets.
